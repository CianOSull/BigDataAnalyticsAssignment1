**Task 1**:<br />
Technology:<br />
Python (without using the MapReduce simulator).<br />
<br />
Your task is to:<br />
• Compute the amount of trips starting from and finishing at each station_name.<br /> 
<br />
_Complete the function my_main of the Python program._<br />
o Do not modify the name of the function nor the parameters it receives.<br />
o In particular, the function must read the dataset provided in input_folder and must open and write the results to output_file. <br />
o You can use the auxiliary function process_line which, given one line from a dataset file, returns a tuple with its content. <br />
o You can also program any other auxiliary functions you might need. <br />
<br />
Results:<br />
Output one text line per station_name. Lines must follow alphabetic order in the name of the station. Each line must have the following format: <br /> 
station_name \t (total_trips_starting_from_the_station, total_trips_finishing_at_the_station) \n<br />

**Task 2**:<br />
Technology:<br />
Python (without using the MapReduce simulator) <br />
<br />
Your task is to:<br />
• Compute the top_n_bikes with highest total duration time for their trips <br /> 
<br />
_Complete the function my_main of the Python program._ <br />
o Do not modify the name of the function nor the parameters it receives. <br />
o In particular, the function must read the dataset provided in input_folder and must open and write the results to output_file. The number of bikes to output is specified by the parameter top_n_bikes. For example, if top_n_bikes = 10, then you must output the 10 bikes with highest total duration time for their trips. <br />
o You can use the auxiliary function process_line which, given one line from a dataset file, returns a tuple with its content. <br />
o You can also program any other auxiliary functions you might need. <br />
<br />
Results:<br />
Output one text line per bike_id. Lines must follow decreasing order in highest total duration time for their trips. Each line must have the following format: <br />
bike_id \t (total_duration_time_for_their_trips, total_number_of_trips) \n <br />

**Task 3**:<br />
Technology:<br />
Python (without using the MapReduce simulator) <br />
<br />
Your task is to:<br />
• Sometimes bikes are re-organised (moved) from station A to station B to balance the amount of bikes available in both stations. A truck operates this bike re-balancing service, and the trips done by-truck are not logged into the dataset. Compute all the times a given bike_id was moved by the truck re-balancing system <br />
<br />
_Complete the function my_main of the Python program._ <br />
o Do not modify the name of the function nor the parameters it receives. <br />
o In particular, the function must read the dataset provided in input_folder and must open and write the results to output_file. The concrete bike to be tracked is specified by the parameter bike_id. For example, if bike_id = 35143, then you must track all the times the bike with id 35143 was moved by the truck re-balancing system. o You can use the auxiliary function process_line which, given one line from a dataset file, returns a tuple with its content. <br />
o You can also program any other auxiliary functions you might need. <br />
<br />
Results:<br />
Output one text line per moving trip. Lines must follow temporal order. Each line must have the following format: <br />
By_Truck \t (time_it_was_logged_at_station2, station2_id, time_it_was_logged_at_station3, station3_id) \n <br />
For example, if the dataset contains the following 2 trips: <br />
o Trip1: A user used bike_id to start a trip from Station1 on 2019/05/10 09:00:00 and finished the trip at Station2 on 2019/05/10 10:00:00 <br />
o Trip2: A user used bike_id to start a trip from Station3 on 2019/05/10 11:00:00 and finished the trip at Station4 on 2019/05/10 12:00:00 <br />
<br />
And the dataset does not contain any extra trip: <br />
o Trip3: A user used bike_id to start a trip from Station2 and finish at Station3 anytime between 2019/05/10 10:00:00 and 2019/05/10 11:00:00 <br />
Then it is clear that the bike was moved from Station2 to Station3 by truck, and we output: <br />
By_Truck \t (2019/05/10 10:00:00, Station2, 2019/05/10 11:00:00, Station3) \n <br />

By_Truck \t (time_it_was_logged_at_station2, station2_id, time_it_was_logged_at_station3, station3_id) \n <br /> 
For example, if the dataset contains the following 2 trips: <br /> 
o Trip1: A user used bike_id to start a trip from Station1 on 2019/05/10 09:00:00 and finished the trip at Station2 on 2019/05/10 10:00:00 <br />

<br /> 
Then it is clear that the bike was moved from Station2 to Station3 by truck, and we output: <br /> 
By_Truck \t (2019/05/10 10:00:00, Station2, 2019/05/10 11:00:00, Station3) \n <br />
