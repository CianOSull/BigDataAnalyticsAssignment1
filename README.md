# BigDataAnalyticsAssignment1
First Assignment in Big Data Analytics Module.

Description:
Used Map Reduce Techniques in Python.

BACKGROUND.

From the window you can see the sun shining in a lovely spring morning.
Its Monday, 10am, and you are in the open plan office of a new start-up, OptimiseYourJourney,
which will enter the market next year with a clear goal in mind: “leverage Big Data-based
technologies for improving the user experience in transportation”.
The start-up is at a very early stage, and has no clear product in mind yet.
However, they have offered a short-term internship in their Data Analytics Department to help
them exploring the datasets, technologies and techniques that can be applied in their future
products. They do not pay very well (0€ per hour), but you see this as a good opportunity to
complement your knowledge in the module Big Data & Analytics you are studying at the
moment, so you have decided to give it a go.
In the department meeting that has just finished your boss was particularly happy.
During the weekend he was exploring public datasets over the internet and he found a dataset
regarding the New York City Bike Sharing System: https://www.citibikenyc.com/
The official website (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) provides publicly available
datasets in a monthly basis. Each of these datasets amalgamate all the bike trips of the month.
For example, the files “201905-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip”, “201906-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip”
and “201907-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip” contain information for all the trips that took place in
May, June and July of 2019, resp.
Your boss thinks this dataset provides a great opportunity to explore the potential of
MapReduce in analysing large datasets. He has already cleaned the dataset for you to perform
some data analysis on it.
